UEFA Champions League - Final

**Can Thomas the Train Engine's PSG Steam past High Line Hansi's Bayern?**

Venue : Estádio da Luz

Referee: Orsato D. (Ita), 

**Preview (Cred. Flashscore)**

~~PSG Will Look to break past Bayern's High Line with Mbappe and Neymar~~

Paris Saint-Germain’s 3-0 semi-final victory was their eighth consecutive win in all competitions (including extra time and penalties), and took them into their first UEFA Champions League (UCL) final after 110 games played in this tournament (European Cup/UCL) - the most any side has played before reaching their first final.

Quick-starting PSG have now netted before the 15th minute in four of their last eight matches (before the 30th minute in six), and have even managed to come back and win the last three games in which they conceded the opener. However despite that, it’s worth noting that all eight previous UCL H2Hs saw the winner on the day score first.

That shouldn’t concern Bayern Munich considering their 29-game unbeaten run in all competitions (W28, D1) is the longest current streak of any team in Europe’s top five leagues. In fact, after their 3-0 thrashing of Lyon in the semi-final, Bayern have scored an average of 3.34 goals per game across that unbeaten run.

However in the UCL alone this season, Bayern’s average rises to an incredible 4.2 goals scored per match, more than any other side in the tournament’s history during a single campaign - eclipsing the previous record which was held by none other than PSG (3.4 goals in 2017/18). With Bayern scoring in both halves in their last five competitive games, as well as 80% of their UCL matches this term, expect more goals here.

**Players to watch** 

After scoring last time out, Ángel Di María (PSG) has now gone unbeaten in all 17 UCL matches he’s netted in (W15, D2) - just three players have a better unbeaten scoring record in UCL history.

Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski has scored in nine consecutive UCL appearances (after the 75th minute in the previous four) - only Cristiano Ronaldo (11) has netted in more.

I do think however that despite the focus on both attacks the battle will likely be won in Midfield, as to how press-resistant PSG can be and break with purpose, or whether Müller can find space and organise his team's press effectively.

**Predicted line-ups:**

PSG: Navas; Kehrer, T. Silva, Kimpembe, Bernat; Paredes, Marquinhos, Herrera; Di Maria, Mbappé, Neymar

Bayern Munich: Neuer - Pavard, Boateng, Alaba, Davies - Goretzka, Kimmich - Gnabry, Müller, Perisić - Lewandowski.",1598217121.0,slept on my left side last night to preserve my tv remote arm,beautifulbozo,1598218954.0,2020-08-23 17:12:01,2020-08-23 17:42:34,Bayern vs PSG

UEFA Champions League - Quarter-Finals

Friday 14/Aug/2020 21 : 00 CET

Venue : Estádio da Luz

Referee : D. Skomina (Slovenia)

**Preview:**

>Barcelona progressed into this quarter-final after beating Napoli 3-1 last time out (4-2 on aggregate). That result saw the opener netted before the 25th minute for their fourth competitive game in a row (three times by Barcelona), and also means the Spaniards have scored three goals before HT in each of their previous two fixtures.

>Although outsiders here at the neutral Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Barcelona have lost just one of their last 13 matches (W9, D3, L1), and are unbeaten in eight UEFA Champions League (UCL) fixtures (W5, D3). Furthermore, that Napoli result also continued a trend that has seen both teams score in six of Barcelona’s last seven UCL games, and the opener netted by the 30th minute in those same six matches.

>A 4-1 thrashing of Chelsea gave Bayern Munich an 18th consecutive competitive victory, the last four of which saw Bayern score the opener by the 20th minute, lead at HT, and win despite a -1 handicap. Notably, ten of those 18 games saw over 3.5 match goals, whilst 13 featured over 2.5.

>Bayern are also enjoying an eight-game winning run in this competition, five of which they led at HT. Whilst they kept a clean sheet in four of those games, the other four saw them concede in the first half. However, the Munich outfit did score 70.97% of their goals across those eight games after the break.

**Players to watch:**

Luis Suárez has scored between the 40th minute and HT in Barcelona’s previous two matches. Meanwhile, Robert Lewandowski has scored 13 goals for Bayern in his seven UCL matches this season (eight after the 60th minute), as he hunts down Cristiano Ronaldo’s all-time record of 17 UCL goals in one season (2013-14).

**Stat attack:**

Barcelona are winless in the last three competitive matches in which they conceded first (D1, L2).

There’s been a penalty in Bayern’s last three competitive games.

The team that’s scored the opener has won the last four out of five UCL H2Hs.

**Predicted line-ups:**

FC Barcelona: Ter Stegen - Semedo, Piqué, Lenglet, Jordi Alba - Busquets, Vidal, De Jong - Messi, Griezmann, Suárez.

**Preview:**

> RB Leipzig defeated Atlético Madrid 2-1 with a late Tyler Adams goal to reach the Semi Finals, while PSG also clinched a late 2-1 victory against Atalanta after goals by Marquinhos and Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting. 

> This is RB Leipzig's first Semi Final appearence and PSG's 2nd appearence after previously appearing in 1995. Neither club has ever won the Champions League/European Cup

> PSG are W24-D3-L1 across all competitions since December, including victories over Lyon, Dortmund and Atalanta. RB Leipzig are the only undefeated team against FC Bayern this season, drawing twice in two meetings.

**Julian Nagelsmann:** ""Simply having a good performance is not enough against PSG. You have to give it 110 per cent. We are obviously happy to have reached the semis, but don't want our journey to end here."" 

""We will not be able to defend against everything. But, the same is true for PSG. The players will need to be bold and create chances for themselves. In the end, the team that wins will be the one that manages to score more goals."" 

**Thomas Tuchel:** ""Like Atalanta, Leipzig adapt to our formation. Their game is less one-on-one, but they defend going forward, very aggressively, very bravely, and always thinks offensively. Their players are young and fast. But there are also certain details that differentiate Leipzig from Atalanta. It's going to be a very physical match and we've prepared for it. It's going to be another decisive match, and we have to find the right mix between preparation of details and freedom of performance. We have our style, they have theirs.""",1597774200.0,who do you guys think is better tactically between nagelsmann and tuchel?,Obi_Myke,1597774409.0,2020-08-18 14:10:00,2020-08-18 14:13:29,Leipzig vs PSG

UEFA Europa League - Semifinals

Sunday 16/Aug/2020 21 : 00 CET

Venue : RheinEnergieStadion

Referee : Felix Brych (Germany)

**Preview:**

>Sevilla’s 1-0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers to make this one-game semi-final at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne was their sixth consecutive UEFA Europa League (UEL) game to produce under 2.5 goals, and stretched their unbeaten run in all competitions to 19 matches (W10, D9). It was also their sixth win ‘to nil’ in eight competitive fixtures.

>The five-time competition winners (UEL/UEFA Cup) have given little away during this campaign: seven of their ten European games were goalless at HT, and they’ve only conceded three UEL goals this season. Making that count by striking late, three of their last six goals in this competition came after the 80th minute.

>Manchester United needed extra time to see off FC Copenhagen 1-0 in their quarter-final and extend their unbeaten run to four matches in all competitions (W2, D2 – outcomes at 90 minutes). They have netted an average of 2.18 goals per UEL fixture this term, and have not conceded a first-half goal in any of their last four European games.

>Often leaving it late to deliver telling blows, the ‘Red Devils’ have not scored before the 50th minute in any of their last five competitive matches. Furthermore, all three match goals in the previous two H2Hs came after the 70th minute.

**Players to watch:** 

Lucas Ocampos’ strike against Wolves was his fifth consecutive goalscoring game in which he netted Sevilla’s opener.

Bruno Fernandes (MUN) is the competition’s leading scorer this season (seven goals) - his last three UEL strikes came from the penalty spot.

**Stat attack:**

Sevilla have received an average of 1.6 yellow cards per UEL game this term (Man United: 1.09).

Sevilla are unbeaten against English sides in UEL/UEFA Cup H2Hs (W4, D2), and haven’t lost against Man United in Europe (W1, D1).

Man United have a poor UEL/UEFA Cup H2H record against Spanish sides (W1, D2, L3) with both teams scoring in four of those matches.

**Hot stat:**

United have been awarded 21 penalties in all competitions (four in the UEL) - more than any side across Europe's top-five leagues.

**Predicted line-ups:**

**Sevilla:** Bounou; Navas, Carlos, Kounde, Reguilon; Fernando, Jordan, Banega; Suso, En-Nesyri, Ocampos

**Manchester United:** Romero; Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Williams; Pogba, Matic; Greenwood, Fernandes, Rashford; Martial",1597626778.0,all the laughing at ManCity yesterday has made me nervous now lLyon,alee1994,1597626968.0,2020-08-16 21:12:58,2020-08-16 21:16:08,ManUnited vs Sevilla

UEFA Europa League - Semifinals

Sunday 17/Aug/2020 21 : 00 CET

Venue : Merkur Spiel-Arena

Referee : Szymon Marciniak (Poland)

**Preview:**

>Internazionale come into this UEFA Europa League (UEL) one-game semi-final fixture at the Merkur Spiel-Arena in Düsseldorf after losing just one of their last 16 competitive matches (W10, D5), while shutting out the opposition in five of the previous six. Significantly, eight of their ten wins during that run saw them lead at HT.

>Though Inter are unbeaten in eight European meetings versus Ukrainian opposition (W5, D3), this game could still be a tight clash as just one of those matches was settled by a 2+ goal margin. Of further note, is that ‘I Nerazzurri’ have not conceded a single goal after the break across their last eight UEL outings.

>Shakhtar Donetsk’s 4-1 win in the previous round bore some significance, with all but one of their eight European fixtures this campaign featuring over 2.5 match goals. In fact, that’s also been the case in each of their previous seven UEL matches, with both sides scoring on six occasions.

>This game could witness some late drama too, as at least two match goals (2.5 on average) have arrived from the 85th minute onwards in each of Shakhtar’s last two UEL fixtures. However, three of their last four UEL matches have also seen the opening goal scored by the 20th minute.

**Players to watch:** 

Romelu Lukaku (INT) set a new record when scoring in his ninth consecutive UEL appearance last time out. 

Meanwhile, Júnior Moraes has been the game’s first scorer in each of Shakhtar’s last three UEL matches (W3).

**Stat attack:**

Stat attack: Inter have won the last six UEL games in which they were leading at HT.
Shakhtar have avoided defeat in two of the last three European games in which they conceded first (W1, D1, L1).

The previous two European H2Hs featured two match goals each, with the goals confined to one half.

**Predicted line-ups:**

**Inter**: Handanovic; De Vrij, Godin, Bastoni; D’Ambrosio, Barella, Brozovic, Gagliardini, Young; Lautaro, Lukaku.

**Shakhtar Donetsk**: Pyatov; Dodo, Krivtsov, Matvyenko, Bolbat; Stepanenko, Antonio; Marlos, Patrick, Taison; Moraes.",1597708458.0,"excited to watch shakhtar, i never saw them play this season",ProMarcoMug,1597708554.0,2020-08-17 19:54:18,2020-08-17 19:55:54,Inter vs Shakhtar

**Trivia**  
  
* Barcelona will host Naples in a competitive match for the first time. The last team to win its first trip to the Camp Nou in the Champions League was Rubin Kazan in October 2009 (2-1).  
   
* Barcelona have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League in each of the last 12 editions, with their last defeat coming in 2006/07 under Frank Rijkaard. No other team has managed to qualify for the quarter-finals in more than eight consecutive seasons.  
   
*  Barcelona have qualified for their last 19 Champions League knockout phase encounters after avoiding defeat away to Juventus in the first leg of their 2002/03 quarter-final (1-1 first leg, 1-2 second leg).  
   
* Napoli have been knocked out in nine of their last ten knockout phase encounters in European competition after drawing or losing the first leg. Their last qualification under these circumstances was in the Round of 16 of the 2013/14 Europa League against Swansea (0-0 first leg, 3-1 second leg).  
   
* Barcelona are unbeaten in their last 35 Champions League home matches(31 wins, 4 draws), the second longest run in the history of the Champions League behind Bayern Munich between 1969 and 1991 (43).",1596930045.0,imagine messi and ronaldo losing in the round of 16,CheekyFifaCunt_7,1596930517.0,2020-08-08 19:40:45,2020-08-08 19:48:37,Barcelona vs Napoli
3425,[Pre-Match Thread] Roma-Juventus | Serie A Match-Day 2,27.0,j0ph7l,"**Preview:**

The *Bianconeri* and *Giallorossi* battle it out in the Serie A big-match of the second Match-day.

Juventus won their last match against Sampdoria with a dominant 3-0, demonstrating that years pass by, coaches changes but the *Old Lady* is always up there as one of the (if not the) strongest team in Italy. The biggest question mark this season, Pirlo's experience(or lack thereof), was blasted away by the treat to the eyes that was Juventus' performance last week.

Roma come from a disappointing 0-0 against Hellas Verona. The *Giallorossi* suffered the lack of their best striker, who had to be left out because of Market reasons, however Dzeko's situation has been solved, with *The Swan of Sarajevo* who now is almost sure of staying in Rome for at least one more season.

**KEY-PLAYERS**

It's far too easy to name CR7, 31 goals, and 6 assists in the previous Serie A, the Portuguese remains a beast even at 35.

On the other side of the pitch, Edin Dzeko surely is the first name that comes to mind. 16 goals and 11 assists for the Bozniak in his last Serie A season he will look forward starting this one with a bang.

Besides the 2 strikers, it will be interesting to see how Pellegrini will behave in the center-mid position. Last year the Roman was one of Roma's main players in the first part of the season, but slowly faded away in his performances after winter.

On the opposite side we might want to keep an eye on McKennie, his transfer went almost unnoticed, yet the young American is once again in the starting eleven for Juventus, after his terrific game against Sampdoria.

Another key player for Roma will be Kumbulla, from his performance will probably depend on the way the match will unfold. The young defender has been on the radar of almost all of the big clubs in Italy, but even with his talent, it may prove difficult to adapt to the way the team plays in only 10 days.

For Juve, a similar case can be made for Danilo who, while being an experienced player, has spent most of his career as a full-back rather than a CB. Against Sampdoria, his new position didn't end up beeìing too much of an issue, who knows whether it will be the same against Roma.",1601234393.0,bLyond of both teams to start without a goalkeeper,damrider,1601234578.0,2020-09-27 15:19:53,2020-09-27 15:22:58,Juventus vs Roma

Arteta returns to Manchester for his first match up against former boss Guardiola. Manchester City have what is sometimes referred to as a fully fit squad, which will be the first time under the stewardship of Pep Guardiola.

Pep is joined in the dugout (socially distant of course) by former mentor Juanma Lillo.

This game will be the second to take place as part of Project Restart™ following Boris Johnson's catastrophic handling of the Coronavirus pandemic, after Aston Villa vs Sheffield United in the 18:00 kick off at Villa Park.

There will be no fans in the Etihad Stadium and this will be pointed out on social media during the course of the game.

The Premier League have decided to have dedicated celebration cameras (yeah), as well as pipe fake fan chanting into the TV feed (yeah), along side special fan cams (yeah) and have employed a streaker, who will be deployed at a random point in the second half, to make the spectacle as realistic as possible during the behind-closed-door return of football.

#Stats

Manchester City have won their last six matches against Arsenal in all competitions, their best ever winning run against the Gunners.

Arsenal are unbeaten in their last seven away Premier League matches (W1 D6), with each of their last five ending level. The Gunners have never drawn six consecutive away league matches.

Sergio Aguero has scored 10 goals in his last 12 appearances against Arsenal in all competitions, netting a hat-trick in a 3-1 win in this fixture last season.
Manchester City have been Premier League champions on this date for 3 consecutive years, equalling the record set by Manchester United.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored 49 goals in 75 PL appearances. If he scores in this match he will be the sixth fastest player to reach 50

> Dortmund has always scored at least 2 goals in its 6 receptions for a French club in the Champions League. However, it is the team that has scored the fewest goals in the competition this season among the clubs still in contention (8).  
  
> Dortmund has reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League only once in the last 5 seasons. That was in 2016/17 with Thomas Tuchel on the bench - the German club had been eliminated by Monaco in the quarter-finals.    

  
> Dortmund have lost four of their last six Champions League knockout phase receptions (2 wins) - including each of the last two (2-3 v Monaco in 2016/17, 0-1 v Tottenham in 2018/19).

##[](#icon-info-big) **Match Facts** ([credit: BBC](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/49791610))

[**H2H**] (#bar-5-green) 

- Arsenal are without a win in their last 12 top-flight away games at Manchester United and have won just three of 27 Premier League matches at Old Trafford. All three of those victories were by a 1-0 scoreline and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer played for the Red Devils in all three of those defeats.
- Arsenal are aiming to win consecutive league matches against Manchester United for the first time since 2006-07.

[](#sprite1-p1) [**Arsenal**](#bar-7-yellow) 

- The Gunners have kept only one clean sheet in their last 11 league matches.
- They have conceded at least twice in each of their last four league games - they've not let in two or more goals in five consecutive top-flight games since August 1985.
- Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored 13 goals in his last 13 Premier League starts. However, he has failed to score or provide an assist in all eight Premier League away appearances against sides from the established top six.
- Nicolas Pepe has converted 10 penalties since the start of last season, the joint-most in Europe's top five leagues (prior to the latest round of matches).


[](#sprite1-p2) [**Manchester United**](#bar-9-red)

- Manchester United have lost three of their last six Premier League home games, as many as they had in their previous 52 at Old Trafford.
- The Red Devils have not lost consecutive home games against sides from London since December 2001 when they were defeated by Chelsea and West Ham.
- Manchester United's Premier League record under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is 14 wins, six draws and seven defeats - matching their results in Jose Mourinho's final 27 matches.
- They could fail to reach double figures in points after seven matches of a top-flight season for the first time since 1989-90. The Red Devils finished 13th in that campaign.
- Solskjaer's side have scored more than one goal in only one of their last 11 Premier League matches - their 4-0 win against Chelsea on the opening weekend.
- Manchester United have been awarded four penalties this season, the most in the Premier League, while Arsenal have conceded the most (three).

##[](#icon-red-cross-big) **Injuries**

[](#sprite1-p1) [**Arsenal**](#bar-7-yellow) 





**Confirmed:**

- Bellerin (rehab - played earlier in U23s) (may still appear on bench, credit to /u/thegogoy)

- Lacazette (ankle injury)



**Major Doubt:**



- Mavropanos (advanced rehab/full training - played significant minutes U23, did not play vs. Nottingham Forest)



**Doubt:**

- Holding (advanced rehab/full training - played significant minutes U23, played at Nottingham Forest)

- Tierney (advanced rehab/full training - played significant minutes U23, played at Nottingham Forest)

- Ainsley Maitland-Niles (full training - suspended for Nottingham Forest, had a nasty stamp on shin vs. Aston Villa)




[](#sprite1-p2) [**Manchester United**](#bar-9-red)




**Confirmed:**

- Eric Bailly

- Fosu-Mensah

- Jones

- Dalot

- Gomes

**Major Doubt:**

- Rashford (according to Solskjaer's press comments doesn't seem to be able to start) (in the squad [\[Sam Luckhurst\]](https://twitter.com/samuelluckhurst/status/1178650002555621377?s=21))


- Shaw (according to United sources, not ready after little rehab)

________

##[](#icon-notes-big) **Predicted Lineups**

[](#sprite1-p1) **Arsenal**: Leno, Chambers, Sokratis, Luiz, Tierney, Torreira, Xhaka (c), Ceballos, Nelson, Nico Pepe, Aubameyang

[](#sprite1-p2) **Manchester United**: De Gea, ~~Wan-Bissaka~~, Maguire, Lindelof, Young (c), McTominay, Pogba, Fred, Daniel James, Lingard, Greenwood

(both of these lineups are very much in the air)
________
##[](#icon-beer-big) **Talking Points**:

**1)** Predict the score, the performance of the game.

**2)** Who starts for Arsenal in the midfield three? (out of Torreira, Xhaka, Guendouzi, Willock, Ceballos, Özil)

**3)** After impressive performances, who should start for Arsenal out of Reiss Nelson, Saka or Martinelli on the left?

**4)** Tactically, what battles on the pitch will be crucial?

**5)** Between Unai Emery & Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who's under more pressure?

**6)** ~~Arsene Wenger was quoted as saying that 'United were 4 players away from a title contending squad'. How valid is that statement?~~ Edit: On review it seems these were fake quotes, [BeIN source](https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/bein-sports-confirm-arsene-wenger-16987795) (still a pretty interesting prompt if you want to answer it nonetheless)

**7)** Should Solskjaer face any immediate scrutiny for his position at United or should he be able to see out the rest of the season with no pressure?

**8)** Who, between Arsenal & United have the better crop of young players?

**9)** Will/should Solskjaer play Matic, Mata or Pereira?

**10)** Is United vs. Arsenal *the* blockbuster fixture in the PL era?

**11)** Greenwood is set to start as the primary striker for United. This game is reminiscent of United's 3-2 win over Arsenal where a fresh-faced debutant Rashford scored twice to usurp Arsenal's (ultimately meek) title challenge. Will history repeat itself? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^/u/nintendo_shill

#[](#sprite1-p10) **[Man. City](#bar-6-txtwhite-skyblue):**

* Man City's win over Spurs was marred by a hamstring injury to Kevin De Bruyne, and while the extent of the problem has not yet been revealed, Guardiola does expect the Belgian to miss the derby. The visitors are by no means short of options in that area of the field, though, and David Silva is likely to come back in while Bernardo Silva may also drop back into midfield if Guardiola opts against starting Foden again.

* Fernandinho is also pushing for a recall which would leave Ilkay Gundogan as another option for a more attack-minded midfield player.

[](#icon-notes-big) [**What the managers have to say**](#bar-10-midblue)

-------------------------------

[](#sprite1-p2) **Solskjaer**: *""It was the best game we could ask for now. The players are hurting. We had a meeting after the game and you can see all the players were really hurt by that performance and the City game is perfect. There is no hiding place on the pitch.""*

*""We have got to be ready for the press and the quality they have got on the ball. When we win it we have got to be ready for their aggression because they will snap at your ankles and heels and kick you. They will not allow us easy counter-attacking. There will be fouls, no doubt about it.""*

[](#sprite1-p10) **Guardiola**: *""We have to win four games to retain our title,"" Guardiola said. ""It is not an easy place to go but it is a nice place to go. We know exactly what we have to do.""*

*""It is a derby and all the times we play against United they are special games and players do their best.""*

-----------------------------------------------------------

[](#icon-info-big) [**Stats**](#bar-10-midblue)

-------------------------------------------

* This will be the 160th league meeting between Manchester United and Manchester City; United have won 62, drawn 51 and lost 46 of the previous such games.

* Manchester City have only lost one of their last seven league visits to Old Trafford (W5 D1), with current boss Pep Guardiola winning both of his Premier League games there by a 2-1 scoreline.

* There have been just six previous Premier League meetings between Man Utd and Man City outside of Saturday or Sunday. Man Utd won the first in November 1994 (5-0) but are winless in the subsequent five (D2 L3).

* No side has won more Premier League away games at Old Trafford than Manchester City (6, level with Chelsea).

* Manchester United are unbeaten in their last 14 home league games (W9 D5). However, they have kept just two clean sheets at Old Trafford in the league this season - no side has kept fewer (also Fulham).

* Manchester City have scored 155 goals in all competitions this season - the record for an English Football League side in a single campaign is currently 156, held by City themselves in 2013-14.

* No visiting manager in Premier League history has won three consecutive trips to Old Trafford, with Man City manager Pep Guardiola one of just three to win both of his first two (also Sam Allardyce and Ronald Koeman).

* Each of Manchester United's last three permanent managers has lost their first league meeting with Manchester City in charge of the club (David Moyes, Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho), with Alex Ferguson the last to win his first such contest, 2-0 in March 1987.

* No player has scored more goals in Premier League meetings between Manchester United and Manchester City than Man City striker Sergio Aguero (8, level with Wayne Rooney). In fact, only Alan Shearer (10) has scored more Premier League goals against Man Utd than the Argentinian (8).",1556146010.0,utd's form for fucks sake lmao  [me right now trying to get enthusiastic about this](https://i.redd.it/dawxsbj5e6u21.jpg),bridgeorl,1556146285.0,2019-04-24 18:46:50,2019-04-24 18:51:25,ManCity vs ManUnited

""We want to score away from home and we're going out to win the game. In these situations you can't speculate. You can't think exclusively about defending or attacking. You've got to combine both. We're confident. We've responded well to difficult moments this season.""

**MATCH FACTS**

* While the Catalan giants have won the last two meetings between the sides in the UEFA Champions League finals of 2009 and 2011, United have won both two-legged contests but will need to improve on their recent home European form.

* United's first 12 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals all came with Sir Alex Ferguson as manager; their most recent, the 2014 defeat by Bayern, was overseen by David Moyes.

* While there is little between the sides overall, United recording three victories to Barcelona's four in their 11 meetings, the Spanish side have won the last two fixtures – both on the biggest club stage of all.

* Barcelona are without a win in their last six away knockout games (D2 L4), scoring just one goal, since a 2-0 victory at Arsenal in the 2015/16 round of 16. That is their sole success in the last eight such contests, with five defeats in that sequence.

[**Preview**](#bar-7-blue)

Frank Lampard's first Premier League match in charge of Chelsea comes away against Manchester United, who are starting their first full season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.

**Manchester United:** 

Manchester United have shown plenty of promise in pre-season but after failing to address all the issues in their squad they go into their first full season under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer feeling slightly underwhelmed.
 
**Chelsea:** 

Chelsea, meanwhile, have club legend Frank Lampard in the hot seat and are looking forward after failing to warm to Maurizio Sarri. The club's transfer ban meant it was a quiet summer at Stamford Bridge but the belated arrival of Christian Pulisic has added a new dimension to their attack following the exit of Eden Hazard.

---

[**Statements**](#bar-7-blue)


**Ole Gunnar Solskjaer:**
 
* ""Of course Rom has a good record and stats, he's one of the top number nines around when you want to play with that kind of striker, a target man.
 
* ""I'm very confident that we'll get goals from (Anthony) Martial, Daniel James and (Marcus) Rashford and Jesse Lingard.
 
* ""I believe Mason Greenwood is going to be playing and involved a lot and, when he is, he's going to score goals.""




**Frank Lampard:**

* ""We have to remain competitive while we are in this position. With the ban it has been easy to write off this squad, and I don't write off this squad at all.

* ""I think that what is important is that you have a target within the group. What matters is how we approach things. We will see how we go.""

[**Match Facts**](#bar-7-blue)

**Manchester United** 

* Manchester United failed to win any of their final five games last season, losing three and drawing two.

* They could equal the club Premier League record of four consecutive winless home fixtures.

* However, United can win their opening match in five successive top-flight seasons for only the second time, and first since 1910.
* The Red Devils have lost just one of the last 26 matches when opening a top-flight campaign at home (W19, D6).
*  United kept just seven clean sheets last season - only relegated Huddersfield Town and Fulham, with five apiece, fared worse.
* They have not secured a Premier League clean sheet since a goalless draw with Liverpool on 24 February.
* United's only league victory against another top-six team last season came at Tottenham in January (D4, L5).
* Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's final competitive appearance for United came in the 2007 FA Cup final defeat against a Chelsea side featuring Frank Lampard. 

**Chelsea**

*  Chelsea lost just one of their final 13 games in all competitions last season (W8, D4), a 2-0 away defeat at Liverpool.

*  However, the Blues triumphed in only two of their last nine league games on the road, drawing two and losing five.

*  They have never been defeated when opening a Premier League season on a Sunday (W8, D3).

*  The last Chelsea manager to lose his first Premier League match in charge was Avram Grant, a 2-0 defeat at Manchester United in September 2007.

* Chelsea were winless in all nine Premier League away fixtures last season at teams in the top half of the table, drawing three and losing six.

*  They conceded 14 goals in their five league away matches at top-six sides, and only avoided defeat at Manchester United, drawing 1-1.

*  Frank Lampard won on just one of his nine Premier League appearances as a player against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (D3, L5), and was outscored 4-1 by the Norwegian. 



---

[**Head to Head**](#bar-7-blue)


* This will be the first opening-day meeting between Manchester United and
Chelsea since Jose Mourinho won his first Premier League match with the Blues.
     
* United have not hosted Chelsea on the opening day of a league campaign since 1958, when they won 5-2 courtesy of a Bobby Charlton hat-trick.
     
* The Reds have triumphed in just two of their last 13 Premier League games against Chelsea (D6, L5) but they are unbeaten in six home matches (W2, D4).
     
* Chelsea are the only club to have won more Premier League matches against United than they have lost, with 18 victories and 15 defeats. 


---

[**Team News**](#bar-7-blue)

**Manchester United** 

* United are without Eric Bailly, who is out until Christmas. The centre back's injury came in his side's 2-1 pre-season win over Tottenham, fuelling talk that Harry Maguire could start shortly after his £80m move from Leicester.
 
* Paul Pogba is with a back injury but will likely play. 


**Chelsea**

* Antonio Rudiger, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, and Callum Hudson-Odoi will be huge misses for the Blues. With N'Golo Kante and Willian also not at full fitness, Lampard's side could look weak in the middle and on the wings.

---

[**Predicted Lineups**](#bar-7-blue)

**Manchester United XI:**

* De Gea; Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw; Pogba, McTominay; James, Lingard, Martial; Rashford



**Chelsea XI:**

* Arrizabalaga; Azpilicueta, Zouma, Christensen, Emerson; Kovacic, Jorginho, Barkley; Pedro, Pulisic, Abraham

* Danny Welbeck is back in training but will only make the bench at best on Wednesday.

[](#icon-info-big) [**Match Facts**](#bar-10-gold)

-------------------------------------------

* If you draw a straight line between Stamford Bridge and The Emirates Stadium, the result is a short 10km connection. But this final instead takes place over 4612km away – a UEFA decision that has been met with serious controversy.

* The Gunners have never won a Europa League crown, while the Blues boast one – but it’s a different story in the dugout. No manager has won this competition more times than Arsenal boss Unai Emery, who did so three times in a row with Sevilla between 2014 and 2016. His opposite number Sarri has never won a major trophy.

* VAR technology will make its debut in Baku as well, despite having never been used throughout the rest of the competition.

* The contest between Arsenal and Chelsea is only the second all-English final in the UEFA Cup/Europa League, with the previous one being played between Tottenham Hotspur and Wolves back in 1972.

* Wednesday’s contest will be the sixth time both Arsenal and Chelsea are playing in the final of a major UEFA competition. Liverpool (14) and Manchester United (7) are the only English clubs to have made it to a final in Europe on more occasions.

* Arsenal and Chelsea have clashed against each other on 197 occasions previously, with the North Londoners enjoying the upper hand in the tie, having won 77 matches in comparison to the West Londoners’ 63 victories.

* The last time these two sides met in European competition was in the 2003-04 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals. Chelsea got the better of Arsenal back then, beating them 3-2 on aggregate.

* Arsenal have lost four of their five major European finals, whereas Chelsea have won four of their five major European finals (2 Cup Winners’ Cup, 1 Champions League, 1 Europa League).",1559165480.0,mustafi will score the winner. not sure yet for which team.,BVB-Oeli,1559167299.0,2019-05-29 17:31:20,2019-05-29 18:01:39,Arsenal vs Chelsea

**MATCH FACTS**

* The Spurs last victory over the Citizens dates back to 2016.

* While Spurs are in the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals for the first time since their sole previous appearance eight years ago, this is City's third last-eight tie in the past four seasons – and a second successive contest at this stage against a fellow English club.

* There has been very little between Tottenham and City in domestic football over the years. In 156 competitive meetings, City have won 61 to Spurs' 60, with 35 draws – although City have won the last three fixtures between the sides.

## Head-to-head

* Barcelona have never lost a home match against Manchester United in European competition (W2 D2), with their last such meeting finishing 0-0 in April 2008.
* Of the 70 previous occasions a side has won a Champions League knockout tie first leg away from home, just four have been eliminated (6%). However, two of those instances have been in this season's competition, including once by Manchester United.
* In their first-leg defeat, Manchester United failed to register a single shot on target for the first time in a Champions League game since March 2005 (0-1 against AC Milan).

&#x200B;

Given the draw, Manchester United were the outsiders of the four English clubs to reach the semi-finals prior to the first legs.

A 1-0 home defeat against Barcelona, the [**Euro Club Index**](http://www.euroclubindex.com/) number one team, has made United's chance even more remote and they are now given just a **9% chance** of claiming a place in the last four of the Champions League.

Similarly United's chance of winning the Champions League this season has reduced to around 1%.

I know how focused the players are: the desire to get to the semi-finals. Will it be enough? I don't know. I got to the final once with one shot on target, and once I had 33 shots on target and didn't.

Football is that game. [We play Spurs in the Champions League and the league, and then Man. United so] if we don't win these games this week, we lose both titles.

**Pre-Match Press Conference Statements**

For us to beat them in the first leg was an amazing result, but we know very well that the tie is still open. What we have is the belief and the faith that we can be strong. We are going to fight. 

We know they're so strong and have a very high tempo from the beginning, but that is our challenge – to try to stop them, to be offensive and attack. We need to believe that we can stop them and show our quality.

**MATCH FACTS**

**Manchester City**

* In European competition, Manchester City have lost all five of their previous matches against fellow English clubs, including all three in the Champions League.

* Manchester City have won 23 of their 25 home matches in all competitions this season (L2), although they have lost two of their last three home games in the Champions League knockout stages, winning the other 7-0 against Schalke in this season's last 16.

* Manchester City's Leroy Sane has been directly involved in seven goals in his last three home games in the Champions League (three goals, four assists), four more than he managed in his previous seven such games at the Etihad (one goal, two assists).

* Sergio Aguero scored 10 goals in his first seven appearances against Tottenham for Manchester City in all competitions but has since failed to score in each of his last seven games against them; missing a penalty in the first leg of this tie.

**Tottenham**

* Tottenham Hotspur were eliminated the last time they won 1-0 in the first leg of a two-legged European tie at home, being knocked out by Kaiserslautern in the second round of the 1999-2000 Uefa Cup (2-1 on aggregate).

* Tottenham have won each of their last three Champions League matches; they have never won four in a row in the competition.

* Each of Tottenham's last 10 goals scored in the Champions League have come in the second half of their matches; indeed, 93% of their goals in the competition this season have been netted in the second half (13/14).

# [](#icon-news-big) News

* The first match of Hell Week between Real Madrid and Barcelona will be the crucial second leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final. This determines who moves on to the final and play either Valencia or Betis.

* Real Madrid will be without Marcos Llorente, who is still recovering from his thigh injury. Isco wasn’t in the squad against Levante, though he has been back practicing with the team. Ramos is with the squad after being suspended for the Levante match this past weekend, they certainly need him with how he’s been playing as of late. 

* Barcelona have two players returning from injury: Arthur is back after missing three weeks with a hamstring issue, while Jasper Cillessen comes back over a month after injuring his calf in training. Only Rafinha (knee) and Thomas Vermaelen (leg) miss El Clásico due to injury, while Jeison Murillo, Kevin-Prince Boateng, Sergi Samper and Jean-Clair Todibo didn’t travel to Madrid per the manager’s decision.

* The first leg in Camp Nou ended with a 1-1 draw. Madrid advance with a 0-0 draw, extra time/penalties with a 1-1 draw, Barcelona advance with a draw >1, and of course a win of any score advances the winner.

* Cristiano Ronaldo will return to the starting XI after being given the weekend off but Juventus will not have Mario Mandzukic to call on here.

* Paulo Dybala, Douglas Costa or Moise Kean are the options to replace Mandzukic.

* Giorgio Chiellini has not recovered from injury in time to make the squad but Emre Can has been included by Max Allegri.

* Daniele Rugani was a fitness doubt ahead of Tuesday's game but is in the squad and expected to start here. Veteran Andrea Barzagli is on standby.

* Federico Bernardeschi will incur a one-match ban with his next booking.

#[](#sprite1-p22) **[Ajax](#bar-6-txtwhite-red):**

* Ajax have recovered Noussair Mazraoui from suspension but have now lost left-back Nicolás Tagliafico to a ban. Daley Sinkgraven may get a rare start as a result.

* Frenkie de Jong is a huge doubt for Tuesday after pulling up with a hamstring injury in the first half of Ajax's 6-2 win over Excelsior on Saturday.

* De Jong's absence may force Ajax into a change of formation and hand an opportunity for Kasper Dolberg to start.

* Matthijs de Ligt and Daley Blind are one booking away from a one-match ban.

-----------------------------------------------------------

[](#icon-info-big) [**Stats**](#bar-10-midblue)

-------------------------------------------

* Juventus are unbeaten in their past 10 meetings with Ajax, the joint longest run for one side against another in European matches (also Bayern Munich v Benfica).

* After a run of seven defeats in eight games away against Italian opposition (D1), Ajax are unbeaten in their past four (W2 D2).

* Juventus are looking to reach the Champions League semi-finals for the third time in the past five seasons, also making the last four in 2014-15 and 2016-17.

* Ajax are looking to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League for the first time since 1996-97, while they could become the first Dutch side to do so since PSV in 2004-05.

* The reverse match was only the third time Juventus have drawn the first leg of a Champions League knockout match away from home - they progressed against Rosenborg in the 1996-97 quarter-final, and were eliminated by Manchester United in the 1998-99 semi-final.

* Ajax have been eliminated on two of the three previous occasions they have drawn the first leg of a Champions League knockout tie at home, most recently in the 2005-06 last 16 against Inter Milan.

* Juventus have lost two of their past five Champions League home games (W3), as many as they had in their previous 45 (W28 D15).

* Ajax have won their past two Champions League away games, last winning more consecutively in the competition between November 1995 and March 1997 (seven).

* Juventus forward Cristiano Ronaldo has scored in his past five Champions League games against Ajax, netting eight goals in total. The Portuguese has also scored 51% of his total goals in the competition in the knockout stages (64/125).

* Dusan Tadic has been directly involved in 53% of Ajax's 17 Champions League goals this season (six goals, three assists).
