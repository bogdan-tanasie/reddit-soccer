Even if you don’t count the monster result against VVV Venlo, it’s still 3.6 per match. Their attack has started clicking a lot more.  On top of that the Liverpool defence is weaker than last time. Alexander-Arnold is a big miss, with no good replacement either. Matip is also lacking a bit of match rhythm so the defense is less stable than last match with Gomez, especially if Fabinho starts in midfield and Williams plays next to Matip. If Fabinho starts in defense then the midfield will be more vulnerable with Milner, Thiago, Keita and Ox out  Tl;dr Adrian starting doesn’t mean all hope is lost, but it could have ended a lot anticipation_n last time against Ajax, and Liverpool’s team has only become anticipation_n since then due to injuries',\n",
